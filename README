Doggy Run Game
-------------

The object of the game is to see how long you can run or how high of a score you can get. You have to run as long as you can avoiding bushes and crates while collecting as many coins and mushrooms as you go.

You will start of with 3 lives. If you crash into a bush you will lose 1 life and if you eat a mushroom you will gain 1 life. If you lose all 3 lives or crash into a crate you will immediately lose the game. The score increases everytime you get a coin or for every 5 seconds in which you are still alive.
